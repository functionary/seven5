Current Dev Setup
=================

* Eclipse with [goclipse](http://code.google.com/p/goclipse/).  
* [Weekly](http://golang.org/doc/devel/weekly.html) drops of 
[go](http://golang.org).
* [Mongrel 2](https://github.com/zedshaw/mongrel2) version 1.7.5
** [Gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode) has to be regularly updated to keep
up with the weeklies.  This is usually just a pull as the author keeps it up
to date.  The version that ships with goclipse will **not** work with the 
weeklies.
* [0mq](http://www.zeromq.org/) version 2.1.10
* [gozmq](https://github.com/alecthomas/gozmq) but needs to be patched
to work with the weeklies. Contact me for the patch.
