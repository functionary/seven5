This directory should contain configuration information about the database you are using
to store content on the server side.  Such configuration is likely to include some database
specific configuration, such as particular options or flags for your application to use,
as well as migrations that model how to change the databases state from a previous schema
to a newer one or vice-versa.

This directory may also contain test setups that are used to "seed" the database so that 
specific tests can be run with the database in a particular "known" state.
