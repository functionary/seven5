<h1>Seven5: The Dev Loop</h1>

<p>The following assumes that you are going to be developing in <code>samples</code> which is actually part of the <em>seven5</em> system itself.  Since <em>seven5</em> is pretty raw right now, we are assuming you don&rsquo;t want to do a &ldquo;install and forget&rdquo;, since you are likely to hack at <em>seven5</em> as well as your application.</p>

<p>Verify that in the step above &ldquo;Building Everything With gb&rdquo; created two subdirectories of your <code>seven5dev</code> directory (created above in the &ldquo;Seven5&rdquo; step).   These two directories are <code>_obj</code> for packages and <code>bin</code> for commands.  In <code>_obj</code> for example should be <code>seven5.a</code> and others.  In bin are the seven5 tools, critically <code>rock_on</code> and <code>tune</code>.</p>

<p>You need to set your SEVEN5BIN to point to this directory of commands, like this:</p>

<pre><code>export SEVEN5BIN=/Users/foo/seven5dev/bin
</code></pre>

<p>This environment variable is <em>only</em> needed because we are not installing seven5 in <code>$GOBIN</code> as we are assuming it is a bit premature for that.  This environment variable tells <code>rock_on</code> to override your <code>$PATH</code> when looking for <code>tune</code>.  When seven5 is more mature, we&rsquo;ll install all the tools to <code>$GOBIN</code>.</p>

<h2>Building A Seven5 Application</h2>

<p>Go to the application directory for <code>better_chat</code></p>

<pre><code>cd seven5dev/samples/better_chat
</code></pre>

<p>and try to build with <code>gb</code>.  You should get an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>(in .) building pkg &quot;better_chat&quot;
index.html.go:3: can't find import: &quot;seven5/dsl&quot;
1 broken target
(in .) could not build &quot;better_chat&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>again, this is product of not installing the <em>seven5</em> packages in the standard place, <code>$GOROOT/pkg</code>.</p>

<p>To remedy this problem, you need to tell <code>gb</code> where to find the &ldquo;root&rdquo; of your build tree, in this case your <code>seven5dev</code> directory.  Create the file <code>gb.cfg</code> in the <code>better_chat</code> directory.  It needs only this line:</p>

<pre><code>workspace=../..
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow it to find all your seven5 libraries in <code>seven5dev/_obj</code>.</p>

<h3>Back to normal</h3>

<p>The normal way to do <em>seven5</em> development is to run <code>rock_on</code> in your application directory with the full name of the project&rsquo;s package as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>cd seven5dev/samples/better_chat
$SEVEN5BIN/rock_on samples/better_chat
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter is needed because <code>rock_on</code> cannot determine if the project&rsquo;s name should be &ldquo;better_chat&rdquo; or &ldquo;samples/better_chat&rdquo;  or &ldquo;seven5/samples/better_chat&rdquo;, etc.  You should see output like this:</p>

<pre><code>Generated _seven5/better_chat.go
Running gb in workspace /Volumes/External/seven5dev
Cleaning seven5/dsl
Cleaning samples/better_chat
Cleaning mongrel2
Cleaning seven5
Cleaning samples/better_chat/_seven5

(in samples/better_chat) building pkg &quot;samples/better_chat&quot;
(in mongrel2) building pkg &quot;mongrel2&quot;
(in seven5) building pkg &quot;seven5&quot;
(in samples/better_chat/_seven5) building cmd &quot;better_chat&quot;
Built 10 targets
Seven5 is logging to mongrel2/log/seven5.log
Web app running
</code></pre>

<p>This means that your web application&rsquo;s &ldquo;main&rdquo; has been generated to <code>_seven5/better_chat.go</code> and the application compiled and linked with the necessary <em>seven5</em> libraries.  Plus, the web server mongrel2 has been run with your application connected to it.  Try this URL:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:6767/css/site.css
</code></pre>

<p>That is the CSS file that is generated as a result of the go-language DSL code in <code>site.css.go</code>.  Similarly:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:6767/index.html
</code></pre>

<p>is a result of <code>index.html.go</code></p>

<p><code>rock_on</code> should be left running in a shell window.  Go to another shell window and try this:</p>

<pre><code>cd seven5dev/samples/better_chat
touch index.html.go
</code></pre>

<p>You should see output like this in the window running <code>rock_on</code></p>

<p>This happens automatically as you change <code>.go</code> files in your project.  This does all the work to &ldquo;bring back up&rdquo; all your changes to the web server as well, so you can hit <code>Command-R</code> in your web browser to reload the pages with the changes.</p>
