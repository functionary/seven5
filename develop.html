<h1>Seven5: Develop</h1>

<p><nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Intro</a></li>
    <li><a href="install.html">Install</a></li>
    <li><a href="develop.html">Develop</a></li>
    <li><a href="pontificate.html">Pontificate</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav></p>

<p>The instructions below assume that you have <a href="install.html">already installed</a> all the necessary code and programs.  You need to be sure that all the environment variables such as GOROOT and GOPATH are set in the shell you are working in.</p>

<h2>Install Seven5 sample program: Dungheap</h2>

<pre><code>cd $GOPATH/src
git clone -b sample-dungheap git@github.com:seven5/seven5.git dungheap
</code></pre>

<p>The above command checks out the &lsquo;sample-dungheap&rsquo; branch into the directory named dungheap. The resulting directory needs to be named exactly dungheap because the name of the directory and the package declaration in the Go files must agree.</p>

<h2>Project directory structure</h2>

<pre><code>dungheap
    |
    +-- link.bbone.go 
    |
    +-- pwd.go 
    |
    +-- dungheap_test.sqlite 
    |
    +-- mongrel2
         |
         +-- log
         |    |
         |    +-- access.log 
         |    |
         |    +-- error.log 
         |    |
         |    +-- seven5.log 
         |     
         +-- run
         |    |
         |    +-- mongrel2.pid 
         |    |

</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Your project name should be the same as your package name in go.  The result of building your code should be a library (.a file).</p></li>

<li><p>links.bbone.go the standard name for a type <code>Link</code> that is going to be exported to the client side as a backbone model (&ldquo;bbone&rdquo; for short).  This file contains the definition of the model as a Go struct and an implementation of the interface <code>seven5.Restful</code> that handles storage and retrieval of Link structs.  It is expected that this Restful service can be accessed with the method <code>dungheap.NewLinkSvc()</code>, a.k.a.  <code>projectName.New</code>ModelName<code>Svc()</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>pwd.go is a file that normally should not be checked into the repository.  This file contains private bootstrap information for the project such as creating the initial super-user for a web application.  It has been included here so developers can see what should be placed in this file.</p></li>

<li><p><code>dungheap_test.sqlite</code> contains configuration data that is needed for mongrel2 to connect to the application in test mode.  If you have the <code>sqlite3</code> application, you may examine the project configuration by looking at the tables inside this file.</p></li>

<li><p><code>mongrel2/log</code> contains logs (duh) including access, error, and logging from the app code.  Application logging goes to <code>seven5.log</code> and a logger connected to that file can be accessed with the <code>AppStarter</code> interface in go.</p></li>

<li><p><code>mongrel2/run</code> contains control files generated and used by mongrel2 to start, stop, and control the server. The <code>control</code> file is a unix-domain socket that is used to tell mongrel when we have changed the configuration or restarted your application.</p></li>

<li><p><code>static</code> contains files which will be served by mongrel2 unchanged. The web server will be chrooted to this directory.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Run the server</h2>

<pre><code>cd $GOPATH/dungheap
rock_on
</code></pre>

<p>Point your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:6767/index.html">http://127.0.0.1:6767/index.html</a> and you should see a welcome page.</p>

<h2>Make a change, feel the love</h2>

<p>The <code>rock_on</code> command is a tool used during development to make the development cycle of Seven5 apps as fast as rum on a Kauai beach. It runs mongrel2, manages the seven5 server and recompiles your code anytime it changes (via the &lsquo;go&rsquo; command).  <code>rock_on</code> uses the command <code>tune</code>  command (both are in your $GOPATH/bin directory) to generate a small main function that glues together your library (.a file) with the seven5 library (.a file).  Tune generates its code into the _seven5 directory; you can see the source code for the main program in there as _seven5/dungheap.go.</p>

<p>To see this in action, open your programmers&rsquo; editor and point it at link.bbone.go. Add a space or make some change to the program, such as in the <code>Link</code> struct, and save the file.  On your command line you should see some messages from <code>rock_on</code> about recompiling and restarting. If you screw up the code and it won&rsquo;t compile, you&rsquo;ll see a helpful error message. Fix the code and save and then <code>rock_on</code> will do it again, and you can keep on trucking.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s your dev cycle: save file, reload in the browser.</p>

<h2>Walkthrough of Link and the LinkSvc</h2>

<h2>Seven5 doesn&rsquo;t do windows</h2>

<p>The <em>Seven5</em> server does no server side presentation handling.  Read the previous sentence again, because it means what it says and that&rsquo;s freaky for most web developers.  Literally, <em>Seven5</em> will not render a template or change HTML in any way as it goes over the wire.  It will serve up some blobs of html if it is static.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need it. Really.</p>

<p><em>Seven5</em> serves up awesome APIs and automatically generates the Javascript to manipulate them.  All that&rsquo;s left is for you to write the UI in the native languages of the web: HTML, Javascript, and CSS.</p>

<p>Take a look at mongrel2/static/index.html and you&rsquo;ll notice that when the document is ready it loads the Site model and uses it to populate the title element.  Remember the Site struct mentioned above?  Well, what you&rsquo;re seeing is the Seven5 provided <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> model which fronts the Go defined data structure with the same name.</p>

<p>But, does that mean that the client has to fetch the Site data every time it loads a page?  Mais, non!  Seven5 also provides a way to tag a Go data structure to be cached on the client using web storage, so in fact we&rsquo;re doing less network traffic by sending the site name over the wire once instead of again and again in server rendered templates.</p>

<h2>Carve out a URL space</h2>

<p>Ok, enough talk.  Let&rsquo;s build something.</p>

<p>When an HTTP request comes in to Seven5 it looks for a static file to load first.  Failing that, it looks at the first element in the path (like &ldquo;plarst&rdquo; in &ldquo;/plarst/42&rdquo;) and looks for an HTML file with the same root, like &ldquo;plarst.html&rdquo;.  If it finds that file then it serves it unchanged and otherwise it&rsquo;s a 404.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s carve out all URLs under /plarst/ (like /plarst/42 or /plarst/really/long/url/) by creating blargh/mongrel2/static/plarst.html.  For the purposes of this demo, just copy index.html to plarst.html and change &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; to &ldquo;Bite me&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now load <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/plarst/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/plarst/</a> (or <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/plarst/anything/really/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/plarst/anything/really/</a>) and note that you are indeed loading plarst.html.</p>

<h2>Move through space and time</h2>

<p>If you look in plargh.html you&rsquo;ll notice that it creates a Backbone.js router.  This is the object that looks at the URL and decides what to render.  Let&rsquo;s make plargh.html show different content for different URLs.</p>

<p>Add this line to routes:</p>

<pre><code> &quot;detail/:plargh&quot;:  &quot;detail&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>And add this function to the router:</p>

<pre><code>detail: function(plargh){
    $('body').empty();
    $('body').html('You are at the plargh named ' + plargh);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To recap, Seven5 will serve up everything under and including /plargh/ by simply serving plargh.html.  Then plargh.html will use the Backbone.js router to render the appropriate content to the page.</p>

<p>So, in plargh.html you&rsquo;d define different Backbone views for URLs like /plargh/43 (a detail page for a post) and /plargh/archive/.</p>

<h2>Enjoy the free HTML, CSS, Ajax and events</h2>

<p>Anything which can be automated should be.  Yes, you can reach a flow state implementing yet another RESTful API and fronting it with JS objects and staying in sync via websockets.  You can also use chainsaws to carve bears statues out of stumps.  Pick a better hobby and don&rsquo;t do it on company time!</p>

<p>Seven5 provides you with the ability to define your Go data structures like normal and then signal how they are to be served by the RESTful API, wrapped by Backbone.js models, cached in web storage, and updated using web socket events.</p>
