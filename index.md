## An opinionated web framework written in go.

## Tactics we embrace like bacon on a cupcake:

### Demand a dev cycle like we're used to with interpreted languages.

### Make out with strong typing and a fast compiler.

### Develop and demo on a single machine but smoothly blow into the clouds.

### Don't repeat {yourself, others, the stack}.
