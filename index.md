## An opinionated, stiff web framework written in go.

## Tactics we embrace like bacon on a cupcake:

### Embrace stiffness. The love of flexibility is the root of all evil.

### Demand a dev cycle like we're used to with interpreted languages.

### Make out with strong typing and a fast compiler.

### Don't repeat {yourself, others, the stack}.

### When deploying to production, go big.

### Configuration is a form of failure.

### Disks are for chumps.

Comment? Playa, don't hate.  Appreciate.
