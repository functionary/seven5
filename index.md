	<p><em>Seven5</em> defaults to providing you with RESTful web services based on your models (simple Go structs).  <em>Seven5</em> also generates client-side support in Dart for manipulating these models in a browser.</p>
	
	<p>Everything, including the client side code, in <em>Seven5</em> is strongly typed and checked.  Any exception to this rule is a bug and should be reported.</p>

	<p>Data storage is a solved problem for 99% of applications.  We support some storage stuff for SQL out of the box, but frankly we will neither notice nor care if you wrote your own storage layer.</p>

  <div class="span4">
	<p>Seven5 has no templating language or other machinery to generate sever-side content; you shouldn't generate HTML, you should speak an API with a client. If you want to do things "the <em>Seven5</em> way," do your content generation on the <strong>client</strong> side.</p>

	<p>We want to know the exact code that will run in the production system and its exact resource usage, even under load.  For this reason, everything is compiled into the binary of the application for production usage--including static files.  We seek and destroy interpreters that run inside the server.</p>

 </div>
  <div class="span4">
	
	<p>Seven5 allows you to have your API specified once, as a set of REST resources, and have everything else--including API documentation--generated from that specification.</p>

	<p><em>Seven5</em> wants you to have one hundred percent code coverage for your unit and functional tests.  Everything generated by <em>Seven5</em> is designed to be testable and to support easy testing for your code.</p>

	<p>We strongly believe that programmers should <a href="">program</a>.  So, in any case where there is a programming task we strive to use programming ideas, notably <a href="">DRY</a>, to help you solve the problem.</p>

<h3>What exactly <em>is</em> Seven5 then?</h3>

<p>
Seven5 could be called many things but prefer to think of it as a set of strategies and a code generator.  Building a modern web application has a lot of parts that are  boilerplate, repetitive and niggling, already solved by others, or just boring.  <em>Seven5</em> generates Dart, SQL, and HTML that is linked together with your application to eliminate this type of work.
