## The Roadie

* The roadie is a dude that does a bunch of lifting but doesn't get any credit.
* He runs the webserver where you interact with _Seven5_.
* He watches `groupies.json` and administers pills as needed.
* He notifies groupies inside _Seven5_ about changes to other files.

`roadie` is the program you run in the directory where your web application is.  You talk to him by hitting port 9009 in your browser.  He'll handle the rest.
