You need to have the following tools installed on your system. With each tool, we provide a link to download the tool and read some documentation if you wish plus a comment regarding the ninja-level  required for understanding this book.


* [Git 1.8](http://git-scm.com/downloads) --- novice ninja
* [Go 1.1](http://golang.org/doc/install) --- intermediate ninja
* [Dart Beta (build 24275)](http://www.dartlang.org/tools/) --- intermediate ninja

For the command line tools, these will need to be installed into your `PATH` environment variable.  These are "git", "go", "pub" and "dart".

You should also be able to launch the Dartium browser from your Dart installation.  How to launch this browser depends on your operating system.
