The topic of tooling is a complex one when discussing web development; one fraught with human weaknesses of ideology and inflexibility.  The battles over editors is legendary ("emacs is clearly superior!") and shows no signs of abating after 25+ years.  Similarly, religiosity of programming languages, operating systems, and even code formatting has been the subject of battles reaching  something-just-short-of-violence.

Seven5 has taken a number of stands on tooling. This book seeks to _not_ take additional stands.  Sadly, in the interest of time, the author cannot compromise to the point of creating different books with different example and explanations for every possible editor, operating system command, and web browser.  Thus, the book proper demonstrates how to develop using

* a simple text editor 
* a unix-like operating system (in practice, MacOS 10.8, but probably very similar to most linux variants)
* Chromium web browser (roughly the same as Chrome 27, but with Dart support built-in)
* git and github.com for getting the sample code
* postgres for the database server
* heroku for the sample deployment
* environment variables for *all* configuration

The author is actively soliciting folks who want to "translate" this documentation for easy understanding on windows-like operating systems, other deployment platforms, other database servers, and with development environments such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.  Please get in touch (see the contact link) if you want to contribute to these, or other, documentation improvements.  Contributors will receive a better afterlife as compensation.
