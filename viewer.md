### Goal: A Basic Front End
At the end of this chapter, you should know how to hook up a simple user interface, written in Dart, to a _Seven5_ back-end. For this chapter, you should check out the code on the branch "book\_viewer" in the same way you previously retrieved the branch "book\_nullblog".  You may need to remove previous version of the source code from the directory `/tmp/book` so that git will allow your new clone operation to proceed:

```
$ git clone -b book_viewer git@github.com:seven5/seven5.git book
$ go get github.com/seven5/seven5
```

### Practice: Setting up the Dart libraries

```
$ cd /tmp/book/dart/nullblog
$ pub install
