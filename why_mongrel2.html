<h1>Why Mongrel2</h1>

<h2>Production Reasons</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mongrel2.org">Mongrel2</a> is derived from mongrel.  Both of them
have extremely well tested and secure http handling code.  Both are known to
perform well under high load and to pass <a href="http://www.valgrind.org">valgrind</a>, so
they do not leak memory.  It&rsquo;s solid.</p></li>

<li><p>Mongrel2 is friendly for deployment/operations and can be easily configured to
work in a cluster.  Mongrel2 can also handle having clusters, not necessarily in
the same configuration, that handle the requests for one or more applications
deployed on the cluster.  It&rsquo;s scalable.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing Reasons</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Test the &ldquo;front door&rdquo; not some other path.  In other words, the best tests
use the code path that is as close&mdash;or better yet identical too&ndash;the code path
that is used by the end-user.  Unit tests in <strong>Seven5</strong> code through the exact
same dispatching (sometimes called &ldquo;routing&rdquo;) as a request in a production
deployment, even in a clustered deployment.</p></li>

<li><p>Mongrel is easy to configure and control programmatically.  <strong>Seven5</strong>
exploits this ability to allow the server to be configured based on its
own conventions of how to develop a web application.  During development it
should never be necessary to touch a configuration file.  <strong>Seven5</strong> also uses
this ability to programmatically start or restart mongrel2 as needed to run
the developer&rsquo;s web application.</p></li>
</ul>
